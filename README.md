# 275-Final-Project Description

If you use this repository as the main repo for your final project feel free to modify/change the readme.md as you see fit.

Come up with an idea for a database final project that will showcase what you have learned during your time at the Medicine Hat College.  Database systems are at the core of most software applications that run locally or on the web, come up with a system that you can implement in a 3-4 week period.

## Come up with a highlevel idea and update this readme before March 23, 2023.

Idea: A video game management system for a game store. 

### Project Idea Title: Video Game Management System

Details: This would include being able to sort games by a variety of things including genre, franchise, publisher, and age rating. It would also allow users to see how many copies are in stock and on order. There would also be user credentials that would allow users to access different parts of the program based on role. Admins could view a log of things that have happened in the program that staff and interns couldn't see. Interns couldn't edit items but staff and admin could. Etc. 

### Complete the project proposal and Database design (or at least your first rough draft) and upload a database diagram before March 27, 2023.

Diagram: I have attached the diagram. Note it doesn't include all the join tables I would need for video games.

# Some specific technologies you should consider adding to this project include:
- Entity Framework Core
- Web Application Programming Interfaces
- Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, or Other front end frameworks.
- Include at least 5 tables
- Make the application centered around a User
- Be creative and utilize your class time to make a great project, find a topic you are interested in!

# Below is a template you can use to help guide you through the process of proposing a project, not everything may be applicable, modify as you see fit:

The proposal is worth 15% of the overall final project mark.
